This repository contains a presentation titled *"A Crash Introduction to Machine Learning with Neural Network"*. The pdf file is the slides. The ipynb file contains the code used to plot the functions used in the slides. 

I have fixed some errors found in the first version after a quick revision. I have not revised is comprehensively though.

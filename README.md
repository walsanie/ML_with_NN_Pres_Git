This repository contains a presentation titled *"A Crash Introduction to Machine Learning with Neural Network"*. The pdf file is the slides. The ipynb file contains the code used to plot the functions used in the slides. 

I have spotted some errors in an early version and fixed them after a quick revision. I did not revise it comprehensively though.
